# Welcome to My Land!

If you are here, you might be someone that I know, some one that wants to get in touch or a recruiter. Oh well, welcome anyway...

I've been around for quite some time now... But I've always been in the shadows, lurking around. Judging code, but not really getting involved. Time to change!

# Interests
I have worked with the most varied languages and frameworks. Migrated from [Java]() ([Eclipse]() times) to [C#.NET]() and back to [Java8]() (using [IntelliJ]()) this time around. In between adventured on the JS/FE land. From [ES5]() (or was it [ES2015 / ES6]()? with [backbone.js](), [angular.io](), looked into some [Python](), but fell madly in love with [Typescript](). Really want to learn some [Scala]() and [F#](). Never really got along with mobile... I need to give it a go again...

Currently working on projects dealing with [microservices](), using [AWS](), getting to know the ins and outs of [Dropwizard]() and [Docker](). Unlocking the [Serveless]() and [aws lambdas]() power. I'm all around. While I'm at it, I might as well keep my [SOLID]() principles nicely aligned with the [Architecture]() patterns. A bit of [Dependecy Injection]() here, a bit of [IoC]() there, a pinch of [TDD]() and that is about that!
# Projects

Currently enjoying a great commute @ [Resilient Plc](). Getting to know [SOHO](). It's restaurants and pubs ([Duke of Argyll](), mostly). Still trying to give back to the community:

# Final Thoughts

I can share one thing that I learned: There is no perfect time to publish your code. It does not need to be perfect, it does not need to handle the all the possibilities in the world first time, this is what collaboration is for. People might be really glad that stumbled across you half developed code, want to make use of it or just give that inspiration. Think of that next time you hesitate in pushing that publish button.

That said, as soon as you publish, you won't want your child code dirty and ugly around. Go ahead and change, just the little tip you needed.
